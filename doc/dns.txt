Since the implementation of the CDN is a simple one theres no need to implement the entire DNS.
Thus the DNS messages that we will use for this project is also simplified.

ID - a 16 bit (2 octet) value that identifies the DNS message

Flags - a 16 bit value where each 4 bits represents a flag

QDCOUNT - number of questions, usually 1. (Theoretically it is possible to have more that 1 question but it doesn't work in real life)

ANCOUNT - number of answers

NSCOUNT - number of nameservers

ARCOUNT - number of additional records


Flags

The 16 bit flag is used to manage 4 different flags mentioned in the textbook.
Since we are not implementing all the flags mentioned in rfc1035, therefore I assigned 4 bits to 1 flag.

Request/Reply - This flag indicates whether the message is a request(0) or reply(1)
Authoritative - This flag indicates whether the reply is from a authoritative server
recursive desired - This flag indicates that the user would like the DNS server to perform recursion if it supports it
recursive available - The DNS server will set this flag if it supports recursion.

Examples

0x1100 - DNS message is a reply and it came from an authoritative server.
0x0010 - DNS message is a request and it desires the DNS server to perform recursion if it is supported.
0x1011 - DNS message is a reply and it return telling the user it supports recursion (This doesn't always mean that recursion was used)


Record Format

All the records that we are using will be very similar with the exception of questions where it does not have a data section.

    /                     RDATA                     /
    /                                               /

Type 

For this project we are only going to be dealing with 4 different types.

A - The record provides name to IP mapping where the IP will bein the format of IPV4

NS - The record provides a authoritative DNS server which can be used to resolve question unable to be answered locally.

CN - Provides a canonical hostname

R - This record specifies a redirection that works somewhat similar to CN.
